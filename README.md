## Lattice Boltzmann Method Experiments

I've heavily referenced [this excellent simulator](https://physics.weber.edu/schroeder/fluids/) in an attempt to make intuitive leaps about why the lattice boltzmann method works. I don't have a physics background, so don't rely on this for anything important.
